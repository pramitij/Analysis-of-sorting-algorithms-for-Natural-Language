The Driver class is the entry to benchmark all the sorting algorithms.</br>
To run the benchmark for Chinese words.
Go to src>main>java.edu.neu.coe.info6205.sort>driver.java
Click on run or Control + R to run the driver class and start benchmarking.

To run the benchmark for Telugu words.
Go to src>main>java.edu.neu.coe.info6205.sort>driverTelugu.java
Click on run or Control + R to run the driver class and start benchmarking.


## Test Cases
To run the test cases for Chinese words.
Go to src>test>java.edu.neu.coe.info6205.sort>choose the test case to run
Click on run or Control + R to run the test cases.

To run the test cases for Telugu words.
Go to src>test>java.edu.neu.coe.info6205.sort>choose the algorithm test case to run.
Click on run or Control + R to run the test cases.

## Resource Files
The files used for test cases are as follows:
1000-chinese-words-shuffled.txt
1000-telugu-words-shuffled.txt
All the input and output files are present in src>main>java>resources.

OutputChinese.txt and OutputTelugu.txt consist of the log output of the benchmarking. 

All the tables and graphs plotted are in Graphs.xlsx
